# GST ML Hackathon Submission
## Overview
* This repository contains my submission for the GST ML Hackathon, where I developed a predictive model to analyze Goods and Services Tax (GST) data. The goal was to explore various machine learning algorithms to predict GST-related outcomes effectively.

## Challenge Details
* The challenge aims to create a predictive model to enhance GST compliance and administration, providing insights that can lead to better decision-making.

## Notebook
* The main analysis is contained in the Jupyter Notebook: Trial2.ipynb.

## Data Description
* ### Dataset: The dataset consists of various features related to GST, including transaction data, tax amounts, and compliance metrics.
* ### Data Source: From the hackathon website itself

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing:

* Handled missing values and performed data cleaning.
* Conducted feature engineering to create relevant predictors.
* ### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Visualized data distributions and relationships between features using various plots (e.g., histograms, scatter plots).
## Modeling:

* Implemented multiple algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and LightGBM.
* Employed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
* Model Evaluation:

Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Conducted cross-validation to ensure robustness of the results.
